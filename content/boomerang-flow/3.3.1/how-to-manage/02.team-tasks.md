# Team tasks

Team tasks are scoped to a specific team, and only visible by that team in the Task palette as part of the Workflow Editor. For more information, see [Getting to Know Tasks](/useboomerang.io/docs/getting-to-know/tasks).

> **Note:** You will need to be careful that when you export a workflow that references a Team task, it will only be able to be imported to a team that has the same task.

## Workflow Editors

In the Workflow Editor, Team tasks are still found in the Task palette and are denoted by the words: 'Team Task' underneath the name of the task.
