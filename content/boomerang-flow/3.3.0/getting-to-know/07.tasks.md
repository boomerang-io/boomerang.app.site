# Tasks

When in the workflow editor, notice the collapsible task palette on the left side of the Editor page.

Tasks are split into different expendable categories. Individual tasks can be dragged and dropped on the Editor graphical interface. From there, you connect tasks together in a left-to-right flow. Click the pencil icon on any task to access configuration parameters for a task.## Task Manager

## Verified or Community Tasks

Tasks can be managed via Task Manager and can be labeled as `verified` or `community contribution`. _We may refer to Tasks as Template Tasks._

Tasks provided out-of-the-box with an installation are labeled as `verified` with a blue ribbon icon located to the right of the task in the palette.

Users are welcome to create their own tasks, that will be labeled as a `community contribution`. The Boomerang community provides support to verified tasks. These tasks are described in more detail below.

## Task Scope and Management

Task Manager is available at the Team and Global level depending on the user role. It is the centralized place to define and manage the tasks available to Workflows and are based on the Tekton Task model, however abstracts the experience so you don't need to be working in YAML directly in Kubernetes.

Tasks follow the Tekton Task model along with Kubernetes standards and allow you to define what you want to happen at the execution of the task as well as parameters that are needed.

### Team Task Manager

The Team Task Manager can be found under Manage > Team Tasks and allows users in the team to create and manage tasks scoped to the team and only available to that team. For more information, see [How to Manage Team Tasks](/boomerang-flow/how-to-manage/team-tasks)

### Global Task Manager

All of the shared Tasks across the instance of Boomerang Flow are Global tasks that can be used by all teams.

### YAML Definition

The YAML specification has three important sections to be aware of: metadata, params, and steps. Its important to note that the full Tekton task specification is not yet fully supported. We cannot run multi step tasks, nor do we allow resources to be specified. For more information, see [Known Issues and Limitations](/boomerang-flow/introduction/known-issues-limitations)

**Metadata**

This includes the standard name and labels metadata matching all Kubernetes object. In addition this is the area where we store a series of annotations related to the end user experience. This is what we store the choices made in the UI that don't directly relate to the Task definition itself needed for the execution.

| Annotations | Description |
| --- | --- |
| boomerang.io/icon | This is the icon for the task as seen in the Workflow Editor |
| boomerang.io/params | This is the metadata around a task parameter to allow it to be rendered in the Workflow Editor. These map to the parameters in the `spec` block and will be defaulted if not provided. |

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    boomerang.io/icon: Add
    boomerang.io/params:
    - required: true
      placeholder: ""
      defaultValue: ""
      readOnly: false
      key: enterpriseId
      label: Authentication - Enterprise ID
      type: text
      helperText: Box enterprise id
```

**Params**

As part of the `spec` block, this is where you define Parametes that are needed for the execution of the task.

```yaml
spec:
  params:
  - name: enterpriseId
    type: string
    description: ""
    default: ""
  - name: clientId
    type: string
    description: ""
    default: ""
  - name: clientSecret
    type: string
    description: ""
    default: ""
```

**Steps**

This is the definition that defines what the task does.

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
  - name: Add Box Folder
    image: boomerangio/box-service:0.0.10
    command: null
    args:
    - -props
    - box
    - add
    - folderName
```

## Task Versioning

We may publish a new version of a task if we want to add additional parameters or functionality. In doing so, these may introduce breaking changes. So workflows won't be automatically updated to use the latest version of the task.

There will be a caution icon displayed on your workflow tile to let you know that there is a more recent version available of a task. You can view the comparison of the previous version and what the new version looks like. You can continue to run your workflow with the previous version, but we suggest you upgrade to the latest version.

## System Tasks

System tasks are special tasks that affect the logic of the workflow and do not execute inside a container, but instead affect the processing of the DAG. System tasks are identified by their system label, that appears to the top left of a task when dragged onto the editor.

| Task Name | Description | Result Parameters |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| **Acquire Lock** | Attempts to obtain a lock with the specified name. If no other workflow in the team is using a lock with that name, a lock with that name and is created. If another workflow in the team is using a lock with the specified name, the current workflow waits until the lock is available. ||
| **Manual Approval** | This task creates a pause in workflow execution. An approver can mark their approval from the execution screen. Once an approver marks 'approve' or 'deny', then the workflow will resume task execution. | <ul><li>`approvalStatus` - `approved` or `rejected`</li><li>`approvalDate` - Date and time of the action</li><li>`approvalUserName` - Dsername of the approver</li><li>`approvalUserEmail` - Email of the approver</li><li>`approvalComments` - Additional comments added by the approver</li></ul> |
| **Manual Task** | A step with a series of instructions in Markdown that can be followed by an end user. Can be utilized for manual steps that may occur in a Workflow. It can then be marked as successfully completed or not and still follows the link states. | |
| **Release Lock** | This task releases a lock with the specified name. | |
| **Run Custom Task** | A special type of System Task. With the Custom task, you can bring your own container and run that as a task. Custom Tasks also have a specialized ability to dynamically create result parameters, see [Getting To Know Parameters](/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/parameters). | |
| **Run Workflow** | Runs the selected workflow separately. It only triggers the workflow, it does not wait for completion. Additionally you can pass in parameters to the workflow if they have been defined. | |
| **Set Result Parameter** | Create a parameter that is set on the result of the workflow. This task accepts a name and value. ||
| **Switch** | A Switch is a subtype of a system task which allows for simple branch-based decisions. <br>This task acts as a logical gate for workflows. The Switch task takes a value. This could likely be a result parameter from a previous task or an input parameter to the workflow. <br>You have the ability to conditionally control the path of execution, based on the value supplied to the switch. If a link coming off the switch has a set label that does not match the value of what was supplied to the switch, then those subsequent connected tasks will not be executed. |
| **Wait For Event** | Wait for an event from an external system to resume workflow execution. The event can be a webhook or a Cloud Event. Visit the [eventing architecture]((/boomerang-flow/architecture/eventing)) for more information.

## Template Tasks

The following tasks are available as verified tasks. Their result parameters that are available for use are identified, refer to [Getting To Know Parameters](/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/parameters) for more information on how to use result parameters or provide input to tasks with parameters.

### Artifactory

| Task Name | Description | Result Parameters |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |

### Communication with Slack

The following Slack tasks are to be used in conjunction with a Slack application. To integrate them with Slack API, first we'll need to [Create a New Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1), and add `Bots` feature. Next we need to add at least one scope to the `Bot Token Scopes` based on the Slack Task specific requirements. Next we will `Install to Workspace` the bot and allow the requesting access permission.
Once the newly created application is installed in your workspace, the UI will show us the `Bot User OAuth Token` which needs to be used in the Slack Tasks as `token` field.
