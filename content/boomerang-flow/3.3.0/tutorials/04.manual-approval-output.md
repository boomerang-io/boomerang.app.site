# Getting the details of a Manual Approval task

The following use case describes how you can create a Manual Approval task and use it's details like: the status, the username, the user's email, the comments and the date down the workflow. We will show how to send an email using the information retrieved from the Manual Approval task.

> You will _also need_ access to Boomerang Flow.


## Create your flow

First, we'll create the new workflow by navigating to the Workflows page and clicking **Create new workflow**. At the modal, choose to **Start from scratch**, fill in the details, and select **Create**.

You are taken to the Workflow Editor for this particular workflow. In the tabbed menu, select the **Parameters** and define our _Required_ parameter, named **sendgridKey** - _the SendGrid<sup>Â®</sup> API Key_. Provide the values specific to your case.

In the left panel of the Workflows tabbed page, expand the Workflow category and drag onto the canvas the **Manual Approval** task. After that, expand the Communication category and drag onto the canvas the **Send Email with Sendgrid** task. You can chain the tasks like in the following screenshot.

Edit each task with the following parameters, using the pencil icon at the top of the task.

For the **Manual Approval** task, enter the following specifics
- Task Name: `Approve action`, it is important to have this name since we are going to reference the results of this task via its name.

For the **Send Email with Sendgrid** task, enter the following specifics
- Task Name: The name of this task, can be `Send Email with Sendgrid`,
- API Key: Place holder for the Sendgrid API Key. We will use the defined parameter so the value should be `$(params.sendgridKey)`,
- To: The destination address of the email. We are going to set it to the email address of the person that approved the task, thus the values is `$(task.Approve action.results.approvalUserEmail)`. As you can see, we are using the task prefix, followed by the Manual Approval Task name, followed by results and then the specific property of the Manual Approval task,
- From: Similar as the To field, for the scope of this exercise we are going to use the same `$(task.Approve action.results.approvalUserEmail)`.
- Subject: The email subject which can hold also output values from the Manual Approval task. We will set the email subject to `Test email approval by $(task.Approve action.results.approvalUserName)`,
- Content Type: Select `Text`,
- Body Content: The email body. We want to show all the information that we receive from the Manual Approval task so we are going to set its content to
```
The Manual Approval task was executed with the following outcomes:

 - status: $(task.Approve action.results.approvalStatus)
 - date: $(task.Approve action.results.approvalDate)
 - by username: $(task.Approve action.results.approvalUserName)
 - by email: $(task.Approve action.results.approvalUserEmail)
 - comments: $(task.Approve action.results.approvalComments)
```

The last step is to save our workflow by pressing **Create new version** button from the top-right corner.


## Testing your Flow

To test out our new workflow, we can run it manually from the Workflows page. Identify the newly created workflow and click **Run it**. In the Workflow Parameters window fill in the parameter values and press **Run** or **Run and View**.

Once the workflow starts you will be redirected to the activity details depicting the progress of the execution.

The workflow execution was suspended waiting for the end user's input. Next, let's click the `Action Manual Approval` button in the Approve action task and then select one of the displayed options. You will notice that the workflow resumed its execution and once it is finished you can check the email inbox. It should show an email similar with this one.

As seen in the picture, we passed the information generation by the Manual Approval task in the email's content.
