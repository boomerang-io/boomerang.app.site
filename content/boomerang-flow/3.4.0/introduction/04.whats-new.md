# What's new

Get a quick overview of what has been added, changed, improved, or deprecated in version 3.4.0 released 3 September 2021.

This release focusses on smoothing out the E2E experience for a new installation as well as new APIs.

## APIs

- A new /apis/v1 endpoint for the start of our API endpoints. In this release we have APIs for Workflow, team, and user management.
- New API Tokens with Global and Team scopes with Management and Administration screens to go along with these scopes.
- 

## Workflows

- New personal Workflows to provide every user a playground for their own automation
- Updates to Workflows page to have a My Workflows and Team Workflows split.
- Fixes to refresh quota checks quicker to ensure the user has the latest information.

## Quotas

- New Team Quota defaults are able to be Administered in Settings and are used whenever a new team is created.
- New Workflow Duration quota available at both the User and Team Workflow levels. This ensures a Workflow can't run past a specific time period.
