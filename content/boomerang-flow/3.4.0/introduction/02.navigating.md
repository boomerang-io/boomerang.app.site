# Navigating

Boomerang Flow provides event-driven Workflow capabilities and specific controls around managing and administering these Workflows.

## Workflows

The centralized landing presents Workflows by team. From here, you create, edit, and run your Workflows.

- **Team Workflows**  
  You will see each Workflow as a tile within the team. You can view the quotas related to your team and see warnings when breaching a quota allocation.

  Click **View More Quotas** to open a modal and see the quotas set for the team and the current usage against them.

- **Workflow Tile**  
  Here you can run a Workflow and then in the overflow menu you can edit, view activity, update, export, and delete the Workflow.

  Click **Edit** to go to the Workflow Editor and construct your Workflow through drag-and-drop onto a visual editor.

## Menu

The menu is the primary navigation tool for Boomerang CICD. It is located to the top left in the header. In addition to providing a means to access the Home page, it presents the following features that support your solution.

- [Workflows](/docs/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/Workflows) - accesses the per repository components.
- [Activity](/docs/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/activity) - accesses your pipelines and stages.
- [Insights](/docs/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/insights) - accesses your custom event driven Workflows.
- **Manage** - provides ability for teams to set policy templates and team parameters.
- **Administer** - provides ability for Administrators to control component modes, global parameters, SCM repositories, team configuration, Task manager and certain CICD settings.
