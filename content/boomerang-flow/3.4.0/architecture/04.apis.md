# API architecture

Boomerang Flow exposes a series of APIs that allows the query and management of teams, users, and workflows.

To use these APIs, you must also have an authorization token in the header of the request.

## OpenAPI specification

The APIs are documented using the OpenAPI spec and can be found 

## Versioning

To make it easier to evolve and extend are APIs we support a versioned API, such as `/apis/v1`, and is done at the API level rather than a particular context to ensure we have a consistent view and behavior for the life of a version.

## SDKs

We currently generate a Java client based on the OpenAPI specification.

_In the future we will also support NodeJS and Go._

## Limits

Our API endpoints have limits on the numbers of requests that can be made with the following defaults that can be edited in the Ingress definition.

| Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connections | Number of concurrent connections allowed from a single IP address | 3 |
| Requests Per Minute (rpm) | Number of requests accepted from a given IP each minute | 100 |

## Responses

Do we both documenting the potential responses? Or is that handled in the OpenAPI Specification?
