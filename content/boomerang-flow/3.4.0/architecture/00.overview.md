# Architecture Overview

![Architecture](./assets/img/architecture-components.png)

The Boomerang Flow application has the following main components. Navigate to the [Application Architecture](/boomerang-flow/docs/architecture/application) to learn more.

- **Front End application**: This is the end user visual designer, enabling no-code workflow building, as well as the ability to see and manage all aspects of your workflows, including activity and insights.
- **Back End microservice**: This component translates the requests from the Front End application and other trigger interactions to an agnostic Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model.
- **Controller**: This controller integrates with Kubernetes<sup>®</sup> to perform and manage executions.
- **Tasks**: The Task workers are containers used to execute the tasks mapped in the workflow using Tekton<sup>®</sup> TaskRuns

## Implementation Detail

You can find further implementation details and feature specifications in our [architecture repository](https://github.com/boomerang-io/architecture)

## Execution

Boomerang Flow relies on Tekton TaskRuns and Kubernetes to perform the execution of the tasks that are a part of the the workflow or Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

### Tasks

There are a number of different types of tasks including pre-built tasks designed for a no-code experience. These are single-focus tasks that offer tight integration into the platform, with certified tasks providing a guaranteed implementation and tested experience.

See [Getting to Know Tasks](/boomerang-flow/docs/getting-to-know/tasks) to learn more.

### Bring Your Own Container Task

The Bring Your Own Container task is a special type of System task where you can bring your own container and run that as a task. Typically, the Custom task has no knowledge or understanding of integrating with Boomerang Flow and we do not force adherence to a specific implementation. The Custom task is denoted by a flag in the upper left corner of the task in the Workflow Editor and Workflow Run pages.
