# Quotas

Quotas help provide limits and enforce governance as to what you can do. There are separate quotas for Personal Workflows vs Team Workflows.

## Workflow quotas

At the point of team creation, a team will be given a default quota set.

> **Note**: Quotas are set by the Administrator. If you have a concern about your allotted amounts, contact an Administrator.

Quotas defined include:

- Number of Workflows that can be created for this team
- Number of executions per month across all Workflows for a team
- Persistent storage size limit per Workflow
- Maximum number of Workflows able to run at the same time

To view team quotas:

1. In the Flow application, select **Admin** | **Quotas** from the Admin dropdown in the upper left of the page.
2. Select the desired team in the **Team quotas** panel.
