Get a quick overview of what has been added, changed, improved, or deprecated in version 3.4.1 released 5 November 2021.

This release focusses on bug fixes and minor enhancements

## APIs & Events

- Fixed team creation API. You can now create a team with specifics such as quotas instead of it only creating a default team with a custom name.

- Fixed Parameters generated from an Event being wrapped in quotes.

## Workflows

- Tasks now allow parameters in the URL input field.
- The schedule trigger now better accepts CRON expressions

## Tasks

- New GitHub Issues Project task for the GitHub Issues Project beta. You could use this to auto assign a project board to a GitHub Issue.
- Additional debugging added to the HTTP Call task when in Debug mode.
- GitHub Tasks were returning some results as double encoded JSON
- Incorrect "Content-Length" of HTTP Call size calculated for utf8 characters makes the calls fail with 400

## Execution & Activity

## Installing & Configuring

- Fixed operators receiving a blank screen after activation as part of installation.
- Added an app-root optional rewrite to the app. This can be a catch all to stop people getting NGINX screen.
